# Description
This Challenge was to, with a given html and css page, create a function in a js file to generate a password after prompting the user on if they want upper case, lower case, numbers, or special characters in their password.

# Usage
Upon clicking the Generate Password button, the web page will ask you 5 questions, the first four being which sets of characters you want contained in the generated password, and the fifth asking how long you want your password to be.

If you are to use a number smaller than 8 or larger than 128, or use a character for the password length, you will be re-prompted to put in a valid number instead.
